#### Web Service (newMap-web)
- [ ] `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` - Your Mapbox public token

### 2. GitHub Repository Setup
- [x] Push code to GitHub repository
- [x] Ensure main branch is protected
- [x] Set up branch protection rules
- [x] Enable GitHub Actions

### 3. Render Account Setup
- [ ] Create a Render account at https://render.com
- [ ] Add payment method (required for PostgreSQL and Redis)
- [ ] Connect GitHub account to Render

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Initial Deployment

   - [ ] Confirm pricing (approximately $21/month for starter plan)
   - [ ] Review environment variables

3. **Deploy**
   - [ ] Click "Apply" to create all resources
   - [ ] Wait for initial deployment (10-15 minutes)

### 2. Post-Deployment Configuration

1. **Database Setup**
   - [ ] Verify PostgreSQL is running
   - [ ] Check migrations have run successfully
   - [ ] Enable PostGIS extension (should be automatic)

2. **Redis Configuration**
   - [ ] Verify Redis is accessible
   - [ ] Check connection from API service

3. **API Service**
   - [ ] Test health endpoint: `https://newMap-api.onrender.com/api/health`
   - [ ] Verify JWT authentication is working
   - [ ] Test API endpoints with Postman/curl

4. **Frontend Service**
   - [ ] Access the web app
   - [ ] Verify Mapbox is loading
   - [ ] Test API connectivity
   - [ ] Check responsive design

### 3. Domain Configuration (Optional)
1. **Add Custom Domain**
   - [ ] Add custom domain in Render dashboard
   - [ ] Update DNS records
   - [ ] Enable auto-renew SSL

2. **Update Environment Variables**

   - [ ] Update CORS settings if needed

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Set Up Monitoring
- [ ] Enable Render's built-in metrics
- [ ] Set up alerts for downtime
- [ ] Configure log retention
- [ ] Set up Sentry for error tracking (optional)

### 2. Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Monitor disk usage for media storage
- [ ] Review Redis memory usage
- [ ] Check database performance
- [ ] Review monthly costs

### 3. Backup Strategy
- [ ] Enable automatic PostgreSQL backups
- [ ] Set up media backup to external storage (S3/Cloudinary)
- [ ] Document recovery procedures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check build logs in Render dashboard
   - Verify Node.js and Go versions
   - Check for missing dependencies

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is correctly set
   - Check PostgreSQL logs
   - Ensure migrations completed

3. **Media Upload Issues**
   - Verify disk is mounted correctly
   - Check file permissions
   - Monitor disk space

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Scale up instances if needed
   - Review Redis cache hit rates
   - Optimize database queries
